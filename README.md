#Requirements
Python 3 (version? I'm on 3.9)
xml.etree.ElementTree (stdlib?)
glob (stdlib?)
matplotlib 3.8.2
numpy 1.26.2

Older versions of matplotlib and numpy probably work as well

Should work by just running pip install -r requirements.txt from this folder
or maybe python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt to ensure you are actually using python3
